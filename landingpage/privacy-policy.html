<h2> Privacy Policy </h2>
<h1> Last Update: February 26, 2018</h1>
<p>
1. User Data. To obtain access to certain areas of our website or to receive certain services we provide, you may be required to register with us and, in connection with such registration, to provide certain Personal Data (e.g., your email address). We use such information to provide the service you requested, to monitor internally usage of our website, and to contact you from time to time about us, our website, and our products and services. In addition, if you wish to make a purchase from our website, you are required to register with us and, in connection with such registration, to provide certain Personal Data (e.g., your full name, email address, and billing information). We use such information to fulfill your order and to contact you from time to time about us, our website, and our products and services. 
</p>
<p>
2. Submission Data. We respect the privacy of our users and the privacy of their client data. All user information contained within the forms you may use or build on the CoForm Site are governed by our Terms of Service. You retain all rights to your data. We will not sell, share data. We will not access your data for non-administrative reasons.
</p>
<p>
3. Cookies. Coform uses cookies. Cookies are small pieces of information we store on the device you use to access our services so we can recognize repeat users. You can control how websites use cookies by configuring the privacy settings within your browser. If you disable cookies CoForm may not function properly. Here are the main ways we use cookies:
<ul>
<li> Authentication. Authenticating and identifying you on our site so we can provide you the services you requested.</li>
<li>
 Keeping track of information you have provided to us. For example, weâ€™ll track the last form you modified.</li>
<li>
Personalization. We store user preferences in cookies to personalize your user experience.</li>
<li>
Site Improvements. We use cookies to measure your site usage to help us understand your needs as a user and make improvements to CoForm.</li>
<li>
 Analytics. We have implemented third party tracking tools such as Google Analytics which use cookies to track usage.</li>
<li>
 Advertising. We work with various third party providers (such as Facebook, Google, Bing, etc.) to display banner advertising on other selected websites. These cookies help us to monitor and improve the effectiveness of our advertising and to refine the targeting of these campaigns so that we are displaying the most relevant content for each individual. </li>
</ul></p>
<p>
4. Safe Harbor for EU users. CoForm is in compliance with what was known as the U.S.-EU Safe Harbor Framework and the U.S.-Swiss Safe Harbor Framework, which was set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use, and retention of personal information from European Union member countries and Switzerland. Here's our official certification notice.
</p>
<p>
However, in early Oct 2015, the Safe Harbor framework was nullified by the highest court in Europe, which meant EU users no longer had a legal safeguard guiding how their data was handled by US companies. In response to this, CoForm has taken the ground breaking step of offering its EU users the opportunity to store their data exclusively in Europe. This ensures EU users can retain their data in their own jurisdiction, which follows their specific data privacy requirements.
</p>
<p>
5. Credit Card Processing. Our integrations with 3rd party payment gateways are processing only. We do not store or log any sensitive cardholder data provided by you or your form users. We follow industry standard best practices to protect security of cardholder data during processing and transmission. We also perform annual audits to ensure our handling of your credit card information aligns with industry guidelines. Read more here.
